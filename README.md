# hello-world
My first attempt to understanding how Github works. I am Starting off with the Hello World Program

I took a year off from software development to gain experience in other areas of information technology with the goals that, the knowledge i will acquire will help gain my decision process going forward.
I will appreciate if someone reads this and offers to mentor me. My goal is to be comfortable with Java PL in the next 3 months and hopefully begin to incorperate other software development skills
